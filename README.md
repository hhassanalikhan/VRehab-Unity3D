Motion-based games for Health (MGH) are increasingly
being adopted for stroke rehabilitation because of their
inherent benefits [14]. In this paper, we present the
initial results of a novel intervention study in Pakistanâ€™s
context, that compares the benefits of prescribed
manual therapy regarding motor functional
improvements of 22 participants who participated in a
randomized clinical trial that lasted for a period of 4
weeks with the pre-post intervention standard
functional assessments (TUG, WMFT, ARAT). The
results indicated that adaptive exergames are not just
an alternative to manual therapy but can also provide
the additional benefits of enjoyment and motivation
(TAM, CEGEQ and informal interviews).
